Blackout Poetry Maker
=================

A tool for making [blackout poetry](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/blog-posts/john-depasquale/blackout-poetry/). All vanilla JavaScript, because I wanted to see if I could manage it. Uses the html2canvas library.  

I've tried to comment my code as thoroughly as possible; this is really the first JavaScript project I've done where I feel like I'm fully understanding what almost all the code I'm writing, and I'm hoping it might be a helpful resource for someone.
